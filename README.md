## Senthur Murugan Real Estate & Financial Services - Website

A modern, responsive single-page website for real estate sales, property consulting, and financial services.

### Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
2. Edit business info in `assets/js/config.js`:
   - `email`, `phoneDisplay`, `phoneForTel`, `whatsappNumber`
   - `officeAddress`, `googleMapsQuery`
   - Social links in `social.facebook` and `social.linkedin`
3. Replace placeholder SVGs in `assets/images/` with your photos if desired (keep file names to avoid code changes).
4. Update domain references in `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` (replace `https://www.example.com/`).

### Deploy (GitHub Pages)

- Push this folder to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/root`).
- Ensure `.nojekyll` file exists at the repo root (included) so assets serve correctly.

- WhatsApp chat integration and property enquiry buttons
- Google Maps embed
- SEO meta tags, Open Graph, sitemap, robots.txt

### Customization
